HOW TO PLAY THE GAME?
üéØ Objective
Be the first player to get three of your marks in a row ‚Äî horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

üß© Game Setup
The game is played on a 3√ó3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).

There are 2 players:

‚ùå Player 1 uses "X"

‚≠ï Player 2 uses "O"

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play
Player X always goes first.

Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in any empty square.

The game continues until:

One player gets 3 marks in a row (wins), or

All 9 squares are filled (result is a draw)

‚úÖ How to Win
You win if you place 3 of your marks in a row:

‚ûñ Horizontally (e.g., top row)

‚¨áÔ∏è Vertically (e.g., first column)

‚ûö or ‚ûò Diagonally

‚ö†Ô∏è Game Draw
If all squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw (also called a tie or ‚Äúcat‚Äôs game‚Äù).

üß† Tips & Strategies
Take the center if available ‚Äî it gives more winning options.

Block your opponent if they are about to win.

If you go first and take a corner, you can often force a win.
