HOW TO PLAY THE GAME?
üéØ Objective
Be the first player to get 4 discs in a row ‚Äî either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

üß© Game Setup
Grid: 7 columns √ó 6 rows

2 Players:

üü† Player 1 ‚Üí Orange discs

üîµ Player 2 ‚Üí Blue discs

The board starts empty.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play
Players take turns.

On your turn, drop one disc into any of the 7 columns.

The disc falls to the lowest available space in that column.

The first player to connect 4 of their own discs in a line wins!

‚úÖ How to Win
Get 4 of your own discs in a row:

‚ûñ Horizontally

‚¨áÔ∏è Vertically

‚ûö or ‚ûò Diagonally

‚ö†Ô∏è Draw
If the board fills up and no one connects 4, the game is a draw.

üß† Tips
Try to build multiple threats.

Block your opponent when they have 3 in a row.

Control the center ‚Äî it gives more possibilities to connect 4.
