# AI Course Showcase Project

This repository contains a short video and a presentation about our Artificial Intelligence course, both created using AI-powered tools. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can be leveraged to create engaging educational content.

## a. AI-Powered Course Video

The one-minute video features an AI-generated instructor who provides a dynamic and engaging overview of the course curriculum, combining theory and practical lab tasks.

### Tool Used:

* **Video and Audio Generation:** Synthesia.io

### Steps Followed:

1.  A detailed English script of approximately 60-65 seconds was written, designed to be delivered by an instructor.
2.  I logged into the Synthesia platform and chose a suitable male AI Avatar to act as the presenter for the course.
3.  A clean, professional background template was selected to ensure the focus remained on the avatar and the message.
4.  The prepared script was pasted directly into Synthesia's script editor. The language was set to English, and an appropriate voice was selected.
5.  Text overlays were added for key terms like "A* Algorithm", "Minimax", and "NLP" to appear on screen as the avatar mentioned them, which helps in emphasizing important concepts.
6.  Finally, the video was generated. Synthesia automatically created the avatar's lip-sync, body language, and the synchronized voiceover, requiring no further edits.

### Blog/Tutorial Followed:

* The creation process was based on the standard workflow demonstrated in the official tutorials on the Synthesia website. Their "Getting Started" guide provides a clear walkthrough of creating a video from a text script using an AI avatar.

## b. AI-Generated Presentation Slides

The 12-slide presentation offers a more detailed, slide-by-slide look into the AI course syllabus, from foundational theories to practical lab assignments.

### Tool Used:

* **Presentation Generation:** Gamma.app

### Steps Followed:

1.  A detailed text prompt was written and provided to Gamma, outlining the desired 12-slide structure and the specific content for each slide.
2.  Gamma's AI engine generated a complete first draft of the presentation, including text, layout, and relevant images.
3.  The text on each slide was manually reviewed and edited for technical accuracy and enhanced clarity.
4.  Gamma's built-in image and diagram search feature was used to find more appropriate visuals for complex concepts like the A* algorithm formula and Bayesian Networks.
5.  The final visual theme, including colors and fonts, was customized to ensure a professional and cohesive design.

### Blog/Tutorial Followed:

* The process was guided by official tutorials on Gamma's website. Additionally, general best-practice guides for creating effective presentations with AI tools provided inspiration for structuring the content.
